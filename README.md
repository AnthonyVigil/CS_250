Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting the needs of the user requires the analysis of the system. By asking anticipated and old users, the user stories can be created which help with the implementation of the program. Asking for the user's needs such as which functions they would like? what would they like to see on the user interface? which users will have certain roles? All those questions help towards the analysis of the system. User stories help understand what the end-user will be using the system for. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? Approaching developing programs requires to manage the process of the project to ensure its success. Some methodologies that can be implemented are the waterfall, agile, and iterative. Waterfall would be a linear phase to phase method while agile will be more adaptive. Depending on the project, it is best to implement a methodology that best suits the project. Scrum is an agile process that can be incorporated into future development work by allowing for future planning.
